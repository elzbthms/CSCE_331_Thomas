                <h4>About </h2>
                    <p>Howdy! My name is Elizabeth Thomas. I am a junior computer science major at Texas A&M University. I am heavily interested in medicine, biotechnology, and biotech consulting and hope that in the future my professional career will combine my love for medicine and technology!</p>
                    <p>Throughout my time at Texas A&M, I have had the opportunity to join various organizations. Freshman year I was a part of a Freshman Leadership Organization called Freshman in Engineering, Science, and Technology (FEST). Within FEST I was a part of the marketing and fundraising committee through which I was able to hone my marketing skills and plan various fundraising events. My sophomore year I became a mentor within the organization to help other freshmen find a community within Texas A&M. Since the second semester of my freshman year I have been an active member of the Student Engineers Council (SEC) through which I have had various opportunities to serve the 25,000+ students within the College of Engineering. As a four-time coordinator for Career Fair, Marketing and EnVision Scholars, I have gained a diverse set of skills which has enabled to become one of the Student Relations Chairs within the SECs Executive Council. Through this position I am tasked with promoting D&I and mental health initiatives to the engineers on campus. Lastly, I am also a part of Aggie Women in Computer Science (AWiCS) in which I serve as a Socials Officer. Through this position I have the opportunity to plan and host various social events, such as study sessions and workshops, to help won within the computer science department find a community within the male-dominated field. </p>
                    <p>During my free time, I love to watch TV (as seen in my ChatGPT Page), cook, and learn new skills, whether it be a new language or a new instrument. </p>
